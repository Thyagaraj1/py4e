Hi Vodafone Team, 

We have checked the config from our side and no issues were found. We also compared with another working Vodafone PRI at Auckland site and the configuration was the same. I also checked for recent changes on our side and there aren’t any. 

Please let us know the following : 
-	Do you see any issues at your end ?
-	Can we have a joint t’shooting session during business hours tomorrow ? We will need help with cable checks, local VF device and cables, etc….
-	We would also like to have Loopback testing done (if required)
